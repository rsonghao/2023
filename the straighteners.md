The orthopedist is so called from the Greek roots orthos, straight or correct, and paidos, child. The orthopedist, by the etymology, straightens children. The term was coined in 1741 by the author of a textbook on the prevention of childhood diseases--at that time the correction of spinal curvature in children was a main concern of practitioners of orthopedics.

Today the specialty treats deformities, injuries, and diseases of the bones and joints (of adults as well as children, of course), often by surgical procedures.

Adjective: orthopedic.

Orthodontia, the straightening of teeth, is built on orthos plus odontos, tooth. The orthodonist specializes in improving your "bite", retracting "buck teeth", and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it that every molar, incisor, bicuspid, etc. is exactly where it belongs in your mouth.

Adjective: orthodontic.

### orthopedic

An _orthopedic_ surgeon is one who operates on bones and muscles to fix them.

The word _orthopedic_ comes from the Greek _orthos_ meaning "straight, correct" and _paideia_ meaning "rearing of children." The term was originally used for children and the kind of treatment they received for skeletal deformities like bow legs or knock-knees. An orthopedic shoe is one that is supposed to help correct the deformed bones and support the weakened muscles of a foot.

### orthodontic

Someone who specializes in straightening teeth is an expert in _orthodontics_. If you have braces, you know a lot about _orthodontics_, from brackets and rubber bands to the nasty retainers you're forced to wear after the braces have been shed.

Dentists who focus on correcting crooked teeth are in the field of orthodontics. Sometimes orthodontics are as straightforward as a year of metal braces, but in other cases a patient might require surgery to correct the problems with their teeth and jaw. These procedures, as well as retainers and braces, are known as _orthodonture_, and the expert in charge is an _orthodontist_. The Greek roots of all these words are _orthos_, "straight," and _odont_, "tooth."
